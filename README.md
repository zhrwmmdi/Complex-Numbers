# Complex-Numbers
A program that deals with all mathematic operators on COMPLEX NUMBERS!

There are two methods in main class ( getNumbers() and getNumber() ) which get real parts and imaginary parts of the numbers from user.
The Complex class has some methods that do mathematical operations.
There is an static object from this class (complex) in main class that you can call any methods of the Complex class with it.

conjugate() method only works on one complex number so you should call getNumber() method before it but other methods like plus(), minus(), division(), multiple()
work on two complex numbers, so you should call getNumbers() method before them.

I also changed some colors using ANSI codes that makes the output more beautiful!!
